# Pokémon GO Damage Calculator

This project is a Pokémon GO damage calculator that allows users to select attacking and defending Pokémon, choose their moves, and calculate the damage dealt in battles. The calculator takes into account various factors such as Pokémon stats, move power, and type effectiveness.

## Features

- Select attacking and defending Pokémon
- Choose quick and charged moves for both Pokémon (although only selecting attacks for the attacker is functional for now)
- Calculate damage dealt per fast and charged attack
- Simulate battles to determine the time to defeat using fast and charged attacks
- Display results with detailed information about the damage calculations
