# PokéChespin | Pokémon GO Damage Calculator

This project is a Pokémon GO damage calculator that allows users to select attacking and defending Pokémon, choose their moves, and calculate the damage dealt in battles. The calculator takes into account various factors such as Pokémon stats, move power, and type effectiveness.

## Features

- Run Raid calculations and simulations, such as...
    - Calculating how much damage does your attacker' quick or charged move deal against a defender.
    - Simulating a raid with the difficulty and custom parameters of your choice.
    - Checking your attacker' offensive breakpoints against a defender.

- Run Max Battles calculations and simulations, such as...
    - Calculating how much damage does your attacker' quick, charged or max move deal against a defender.
    - Building up to 4 teams to run an advanced simulation of a Max Battle (BETA) with the difficulty and custom parameters of your choice.
    - Calculating how much damage the defender will deal to your Pokémon with their large or targeted moves.
    - Checking your attacker' offensive breakpoints against a defender.

- Check the rankings of any Max Boss to know which are the best Tanks and best Attackers against one Boss.

- Export any pokémon you like to import their data at any moment!

- Copy any setup from the page to send it to anyone!
